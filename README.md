# Airy Library! 
Here's a fun little project that I put together in a few hours. I really enjoy component libraries and thought I'd whip up a small one to show off for my portfolio! I'll be adding to it occasionally and will add different themes and colors because one is never enough! 

# Demo Page
To run the demo page, use `npm start` or `yarn start`. Use whichever you want. I don't judge.
Or go (here)[https://marbaez1714.github.io/airy-library/] where's it's all up and running and pretty and whatnot.
